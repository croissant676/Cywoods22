9 Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: 
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, Give me my Travy; and,
when he shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make
the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with 
night And pay no worship to the garish sun.
